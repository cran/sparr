sparr
=====

This is a place-holder repository for the `sparr` package, for estimating relative-risk for spatial (and in future, spatio-temporal)
risk surfaces.

It is place-holder in that the maintainer does not (currently) use git, while another contributer (@jmarshallnz) thinks this
is silly.

Installation
============

In the future this README will be of some use. For now, you can play with the (old) version of with the package
that is on CRAN. Version 2 will be on CRAN shortly, perhaps once I'm done updating the build system.

If you wish to install it in the meantime, you can use `devtools`

```
devtools::install_github('jmarshallnz/sparr')
```

Usage
