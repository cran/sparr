\usage{
LSCV.risk(f, g = NULL, hlim = NULL, hseq = NULL, type = c("fixed",
  "adaptive"), method = c("kelsall-diggle", "hazelton", "davies"),
  resolution = 64, edge = TRUE, hp = NULL, pilot.symmetry = c("none",
  "f", "g", "pooled"), auto.optim = TRUE, seqres = 30, parallelise = NA,
  verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{Either a pre-calculated object of class \code{\link{bivden}}
representing the `case' (numerator) density estimate, or an object of class
\code{\link[spatstat]{ppp}} giving the observed case data. Alternatively, if
\code{f} is \code{\link[spatstat]{ppp}} object with dichotomous
factor-valued \code{\link[spatstat]{marks}}, the function treats the first
level as the case data, and the second as the control data, obviating the
need to supply \code{g}.}

\item{g}{As for \code{f}, for the `control' (denominator) density; this
object must be of the same class as \code{f}. Ignored if, as stated above,
\code{f} contains both case and control observations.}

\item{hlim}{An optional vector of length 2 giving the limits of the
optimisation routine with respect to the bandwidth. If unspecified, the
function attempts to choose this automatically.}

\item{hseq}{An optional increasing sequence of bandwidth values at which to
manually evaluate the optimisation criterion. Used only in the case
\code{(!auto.optim && is.null(hlim))}.}

\item{type}{A character string; \code{"fixed"} (default) performs classical leave-one-out
cross-validation for a jointly optimal fixed bandwidth. Alternatively, \code{"adaptive"} utilises
multiscale adaptive kernel estimation (Davies & Baddeley, 2018) to run the cross-validation
in an effort to find a suitable jointly optimal, common global bandwidth for the adaptive relative risk function. See `Details'.}

\item{method}{A character string controlling the selector to use. There are
three types, based on either the mean integrated squared error (MISE)
(Kelsall and Diggle, 1995; default -- \code{method = "kelsall-diggle"}); a
weighted MISE (Hazelton, 2008 -- \code{method = "hazelton"}); or an
approximation to the asymptotic MISE (Davies, 2013 -- \code{method =
"davies"}). See `Details'.}

\item{resolution}{Spatial grid size; the optimisation will be based on a
[\code{resolution} \eqn{\times}{x} \code{resolution}] density estimate.}

\item{edge}{Logical value indicating whether to edge-correct the density
estimates used.}

\item{hp}{A single numeric value or a vector of length 2 giving the pilot
bandwidth(s) to be used for estimation of the pilot
densities for adaptive risk surfaces. Ignored if \code{type = "fixed"}.}

\item{pilot.symmetry}{A character string used to control the type of
symmetry, if any, to use for the bandwidth factors when computing an
adaptive relative risk surface. See `Details'. Ignored if \code{type = "fixed"}.}

\item{auto.optim}{Logical value indicating whether to automate the numerical
optimisation using \code{\link{optimise}}. If \code{FALSE}, the optimisation
criterion is evaluated over \code{hseq} (if supplied), or over a seqence of
values controlled by \code{hlim} and \code{seqres}.}

\item{seqres}{Optional resolution of an increasing sequence of bandwidth
values. Only used if \code{(!auto.optim && is.null(hseq))}.}

\item{parallelise}{Numeric argument to invoke parallel processing, giving
the number of CPU cores to use when \code{!auto.optim}. Experimental. Test
your system first using \code{parallel::detectCores()} to identify the
number of cores available to you.}

\item{verbose}{Logical value indicating whether to provide function progress
commentary.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments such as \code{dimz} and \code{trim} to be passed to
the internal calls to \code{\link{multiscale.density}}.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value of the estimated bandwidth (if
  \code{auto.optim = TRUE}). Otherwise, a list of two numeric vectors of equal
  length giving the bandwidth sequence (as \code{hs}) and corresponding CV
  function value (as \code{CV}).

\description{
Methods to find a jointly optimal, common case-control isotropic bandwidth for use in
estimation of the fixed or adaptive kernel-smoothed relative risk function.
}
\details{
Given the established preference of using a common bandwidth for both case
and control density estimates when constructing a relative
risk surface, This function calculates a `jointly optimal', common isotropic
LSCV bandwidth for the (Gaussian) kernel-smoothed relative risk function
(case-control density-ratio). It can be shown that choosing a bandwidth that
is equal for both case and control density estimates is preferable to
computing `separately optimal' bandwidths (Kelsall and Diggle, 1995). The user
can choose to either calculate a common smoothing parameter for a fixed-bandwidth
relative risk surface (\code{type = "fixed"}; default), or a common global bandwidth for
an adaptive risk surface (\code{type = "adaptive"}). See further comments below.



\itemize{
  \item\code{method = "kelsall-diggle"}: the function computes the
    common bandwidth which minimises the approximate mean integrated squared
    error (MISE) of the log-transformed risk surface (Kelsall and Diggle, 1995).
  \item\code{method = "hazelton"}: the function minimises a
    \emph{weighted-by-control} MISE of the (raw) relative risk function
    (Hazelton, 2008).
  \item\code{method = "davies"}: the optimal bandwidth is
    one that minimises a crude plug-in approximation to the \emph{asymptotic}
    MISE (Davies, 2013). Only possible for \code{type = "fixed"}.
}

For jointly optimal, common global bandwidth selection when \code{type = "adaptive"}, the
optimisation routine utilises \code{\link{multiscale.density}}. Like \code{\link{LSCV.density}},
the leave-one-out procedure does not affect the pilot density, for which additional
control is offered via the \code{hp} and \code{pilot.symmetry} arguments. The user has the option of
obtaining a so-called \emph{symmetric} estimate (Davies et al. 2016) via
\code{pilot.symmetry}. This amounts to choosing the same pilot density for
both case and control densities. By choosing \code{"none"} (default), the
result uses the case and control data separately for the fixed-bandwidth
pilots, providing the original asymmetric density-ratio of Davies and
Hazelton (2010). By selecting either of \code{"f"}, \code{"g"}, or
\code{"pooled"}, the pilot density is calculated based on the case, control,
or pooled case/control data respectively (using \code{hp[1]} as the fixed
bandwidth). Davies et al. (2016) noted some beneficial practical behaviour
of the symmetric adaptive surface over the asymmetric. (The pilot bandwidth(s), if not supplied in \code{hp}, are calculated
internally via default use of \code{\link{LSCV.density}}, using the requested symmetric-based data set, or separately with respect to the case and control datasets \code{f} and \code{g} if
\code{pilot.symmetry = "none"}.)
}
\section{Warning}{
 The jointly optimal bandwidth selector can be
computationally expensive for large data sets and fine evaluation grid
resolutions. The user may need to experiment with adjusting \code{hlim} to
find a suitable minimum.
