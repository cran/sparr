#' Primary biliary cirrhosis data
#' 
#' Data of the locations of 761 cases of primary biliary cirrhosis in several
#' adjacent health regions of north-eastern England, along with 3020 controls
#' representing the at-risk population, collected between 1987 and 1994. These
#' data were first presented and analysed by Prince et al. (2001); subsequent
#' analysis of these data in the spirit of \code{\link{sparr}} was performed in
#' Davies and Hazelton (2010). Also included is the polygonal study region.

#' @name pbc
#' @format \code{pbc} is a dichotomously marked
