	CHANGES IN sparr VERSION 0.3-7
	   
    o Modifications to ‘tolerance’ to stabilise and improve Monte-Carlo (MC) tolerance contours. ‘pooled’ is now no longer a required argument for MC contours. The capability of computing adaptive-symmetric and adaptive-asymmetric MC contours is available. New choices for specifying bandwidths at each iteration of the MC loop are provided for both fixed- and adaptive-bandwidth estimators. See function documentation.

    o Speedier plotting of borders and contours when producing the interactive 3D visualisations of a density or risk surface via ‘plot.bivden’ and ‘plot.rrs’.

    o General tidying up of output to the console during the execution of certain functions.


	CHANGES IN sparr VERSION 0.3-4
	
   
    o Added functionality to ‘bivariate.density’ to allow the external specification of a pilot density for adaptive estimation through the new argument ‘pref’. See function documentation.
