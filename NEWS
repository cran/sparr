	CHANGES IN sparr VERSION 0.3-1

OVERVIEW 

   o Expanded bandwidth selection

   o Removal of 'CV.sm' and dependency on package 'sm'

   o Conversion to 'spatstat' pixel images
   
   o PBC data set now a 'ppp.object'
   
   o Documentation updates

NEW FUNCTIONS

   o LSCV.density
     Standalone (bivariate) density bandwidth selection
	     using leave-one-out least-squares cross-validation

   o LSCV.risk
     Jointly optimal, common case-control bandwidth selection
	     via two distinct methods

   o NS
     Normal scale optimal bandwidth for bivariate data
	 
   o as.im.bivden and as.im.rrs
     Conversion of 'bivden' and 'rrs' objects into a 'spatstat'
	     pixel image ('im') object

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

   o PBC
     This data set is now a 'spatstat' 'ppp.object';
	     ease of access thereby increased

   o CV.sm and dependency on package 'sm'
     Gone

BUG FIXES

   o CV.sm
     Did not incorporate edge-correction. Approximations made
	     by the corresponding 'sm' functions unsatisfactory,
	     occassionally resulting in incorrect results.
	     Fixed by removal and replacement with 'LSCV.density'.
